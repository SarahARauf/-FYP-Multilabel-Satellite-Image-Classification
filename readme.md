# Satellite Image Classification Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains a deep learning pipeline for classifying satellite images. The pipeline leverages modern deep learning frameworks and pre-trained models to achieve high performance on satellite imagery tasks.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Efficient handling of satellite image datasets, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- **Modeling**: Integration of state-of-the-art deep learning models for image classification.
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- **Visualization**: Tools for visualizing predictions and understanding model outputs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- GPU with CUDA support (optional but recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/satellite-image-classification.git
   cd satellite-image-classification
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   env\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

#### Data Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script to prepare your dataset:
```bash
python scripts/preprocess.py --input-dir data/raw --output-dir data/processed
```

#### Training
Train the model using the training script:
```bash
python scripts/train.py --data-dir data/processed --epochs 50 --batch-size 32
```

#### Evaluation
Evaluate the model performance:
```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py --model-path models/checkpoint.pth --data-dir data/processed
```

## Visualization
To visualize predictions, use the built-in tools provided in `notebooks/visualize_predictions.ipynb`.
